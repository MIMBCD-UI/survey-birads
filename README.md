This repository contains the source for a [BIRADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RADS) survey version developed using [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory, while the *samples* can be found at [`samples/`](samples/) directory. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
